# Huon Valley Golf Club Visitor Portal

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based portal for Huon Valley Golf Club to streamline visitor payments, membership management, and equipment hire. It is designed to provide an intuitive user experience for visitors and club members alike, incorporating features such as:

- **Visitor Fee Payment**: A form for non-members to pay green fees using Square's payment processing.
- **Member Portal Access**: Direct link to the club's member portal for ease of access.
- **Equipment Hire Options**: Optional club and buggie hire for visitors, which gets added to their total payment.
- **Mobile and Desktop Compatibility**: Fully responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
The project includes the following key features:

### **Features**
- **Green Fees Payment**: Visitors can pay their green fees online. Once integrated with Square, it will allow secure payment processing.
- **Membership Options**: A button linking to the members' portal for existing members.
- **Equipment Hire**: Optional equipment hire for visitors, allowing them to add items like clubs or a buggie to their payment.
- **Visitor and Member Links**: Easy access to the visitor information page and membership application form on the club's official website.

## MAC Address Tracking
In addition to processing visitor payments, the system also tracks MAC addresses of devices connected to the club's guest Wi-Fi. This allows the system to:

- Identify visitors and prompt them to pay green fees.
- Ensure repeat visitors are only charged once per day, even if they reconnect to the Wi-Fi later.
- Store the MAC address for future visits, making it easier to recognize returning players.

This feature improves security and ensures that all visitors pay the necessary fees while playing on the course.
